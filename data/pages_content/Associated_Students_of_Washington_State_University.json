One of the earliest key pieces legislation and projects under the 47th Senate (Fall 2017 to Spring 2018) was re-establishing the 'Issues & Forums' committee that fosters political discussion between different points of view, which was led by Senator Schilperoort of the Washington State University College of Agricultural, Human, and Natural Resource Sciences. Another major endeavor was renaming a plaza on campus on behalf of the Multicultural Greek Community at WSU, partly led by Senator Hernandez of the Carson College of Business. All-Campus Senator Pielow authored bills to strengthen the independent and unbiased role of an election board, initiating requirements for all Senators to disclose their affiliated RSOs to tackle fiscal nepotism, and introducing new voter registration campaigns at WSU's dorms during the Week of Welcome. Senators Parchem and Dalton, along with Delegate Brown, attempted to introduce a mandatory sports pass for all undergraduates at WSU, though it was eventually thwarted by Senator Pielow. Honors College Delegate Arend had authored and passed a constitutional amendment that changed the position of Honors College Delegate into Honors College Senator, which was eventually passed and ratified by the voters.\n\n\n\nASWSU on all campuses recently voted to opt out of the Washington Student Association as a lobbying group. Campus leaders did not believe the lobbying group was providing enough for what students' were paying. ASWSU President (Pullman) Jake Bredstrand also remarked that the addition of community colleges in the lobbying group as it \"brings in other schools that have needs far different from ours\".  The campus newspaper (The Daily Evergreen) recently supported the decision, stating their opinion that \"A coalition can be accomplished without a middle-man like the WSA and if it involves more direct talk between Washington colleges, then we all might find a way out of this budget crisis together\".  ASWSU will now form a \"Cougar Coalition\" that will lobby exclusively for Washington State University.\n\n\n\nWashington State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASWSU Official Website",
