  "body": "Pollock roe, also pollack roe (also known as myeongnan and tarako) is the roe of Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) which, despite its name, is a species of cod. Salted pollock roe is a popular culinary ingredient in Korean, Japanese, and Russian cuisines.\n\n\n\nIn Korean, pollock roe is called myeongnan (\uba85\ub780,\u660e\u5375), while the salted roe dish is called myeongnan-jeot (\uba85\ub780\uc813), being considered a type of jeotgal (salted seafood). The Korean word myeongnan (\uba85\ub780) means pollock roe as myeong (\uba85,\u660e) came from myeongtae (\uba85\ud0dc,\u660e\u592a), the Korean word for Alaska pollocks, and ran (\ub780,\u5375), also pronounced nan, means \"egg (roe)\". As jeot (\uc813) is a category of salted seafood, the compound myeongnan-jeot (\uba85\ub780\uc813) refers to salted pollock roe.\nThe Japanese word for the pollock roe is called  tarako. The pollock food products are often  called, karashi-mentaiko or  mentaiko is a compound of mentai (\u660e\u592a), borrowed from its Korean cognate myeongtae meaning Alaska pollock, and ko (\u5b50), a Japanese word for \"child (roe)\". Alaska pollocks are called suket\u014ddara (\u4ecb\u515a\u9c48) in Japanese. Tara (\u9c48) means cod in Japanese. Tarako (\u9c48\u5b50) literally means \"cod roe\", but generally refers to smaller salted roe sacs.In Russian, pollock roe is called ikra mintaya (\u0438\u043a\u0440\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u044f). The word is also used to referred to the salted roe. The Russian word ikra (\u0438\u043a\u0440\u0430) means \"roe\" and mintaya (\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u044f) is the singular genitive form of mintay (\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0439), which means Alaska pollock. The word also derived from its Korean cognate, myeongtae (\uba85\ud0dc).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKoreans have been enjoying pollock roe since the Joseon era (1392\u20131897). One of the earliest mentions are from Diary of the Royal Secretariat, where a 1652 entry stated: \"The management administration should be strictly interrogated for bringing in pollock roe instead of cod roe.\" Recipe for salted pollock roe is found in a 19th-century cookbook, Siuijeonseo.\n\n\n\nA 1696 Japanese book records the use of Alaska pollock's roe in Northern land.The dish mentaiko originates from Korea and is originally the Korean myeongnan-jeot. Toshio Kawahara (\u5ddd\u539f \u4fca\u592b, Kawahara Toshio), who was born in the city of Busan, Korea during the Japanese occupation, founded the oldest mentaiko company in Japan called \"Aji no Mentaiko Fukuya\" (ja:\u3075\u304f\u3084) after World War II. He made slight modifications to myeongnan-jeot to adapt to Japanese tastes and introduced it to Japan as \"Karashi mentaiko\" (ja:\u8f9b\u5b50\u660e\u592a\u5b50), its popular name is \"mentaiko\". The milder, less spicy version is called tarako (\u9c48\u5b50) in Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, myeongnan-jeot was made before dongji (winter solstice). Intact skeins of Alaska pollock roe are washed carefully with salt water, then salted in a sokuri (bamboo basket). The ratio of salt to roe ranges from less than 5:100 to more than 15:100. After 2\u20133 days, salted and drained roe is marinated for at least a day with fine gochutgaru (chilli powder) and finely minced garlic. myeongnan-jeot is usually served with sesame seeds or some drops of sesame oil.\nMyeongnan-jeot, whether raw, dried, and/or cooked, is a common banchan (side dish) and anju (food served with alcoholic beverages). It is also used in a variety of dishes, such as gyeran-jjim (steamed egg), bokkeum-bap (fried rice), and recently in Korean-style Italian pasta dishes.\nMyeongnan-jeot is a specialty of South Hamgyong Province of North Korea, and Gangwon Province and Busan of South Korea.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\nMentaiko, adapted from Korean myeongnan-jeot, hence the name mentai myeongtae (\uba85\ud0dc,\u660e\u592a, pollack) + ko(\uc54c, \u5b50, baby or roe)], is common in Japan. It is made in a variety of flavors and colors and is available at airports and main train stations. It is usually eaten with onigiri, but is also enjoyed by itself with sake. A common variety is spicy mentaiko (\u8f9b\u5b50\u660e\u592a\u5b50, karashi mentaiko). It is a product of the Hakata ward of Fukuoka City. Milder version is called tarako (\u9c48\u5b50),\nRecently in Japan, mentaiko pasta has become common.  Mentaiko is mixed with butter or mayonnaise and used as a sauce for spaghetti.  Thin strips of Nori (\u6d77\u82d4) and Shiso leaves are often sprinkled on top.\nMentaiko was nominated as Japan's number one side dish in the Japanese weekly magazine, Sh\u016bkan Bunshun.Tarako is served in a number of ways: plain (usually for breakfast), as a filling for onigiri, and as a pasta sauce (usually with nori). Traditionally, tarako was dyed bright red, but recent concerns about the safety of food coloring have all but eliminated that custom. In Ky\u016bsh\u016b, tarako is commonly served with red chili pepper flakes.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\nIn Russia, pollock roe is consumed as a sandwich spread. The product, resembling liquid paste due to the small size of eggs and oil added, is sold canned.\n\n\n\n\nAlaska pollock as food\nJeotgal\nMasago\nTobiko\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Media related to Pollock roe at Wikimedia Commons",
