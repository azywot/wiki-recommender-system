Point Of No Return's lyrics primarily focused on \"Third World struggles\" and animal liberation issues. Their sound was described as a mix of Earth Crisis metal mosh with death metal elements. The band had three singers, like their North American counterpart, Path of Resistance.Point Of No Return's first full-length album, Centelha (\u201cSparks\u201d), was released on CD by Liberation Records in Brazil and Catalyst Records in the United States. The band toured internationally, first to Europe in 2000 and then to Argentina in 2001. After a seven month hiatus and an alleged \"last show\" in Argentina, the band came back with a second album in 2002, Liberdade Imposta, Liberdade Conquistada (\u201cImposed Freedom, Conquered Freedom\u201d) and returned to tour Europe a second time. The songs on this second album\u2014this time with lyrics completely in Portuguese\u2014dealt with sociopolitical issues and were more deeply melancholic, but also carried a strong influence from bands like Cro-Mags, Judge, and Napalm Death.\nPoint of No Return played their final show in 2006.\n\n\n\nAlexandre Fanuchi, aka Kalota \u2013 vocals\nFrederico Freitas \u2013 vocals\nMarcos Suarez \u2013 vocals\nTarc\u00edsio Leite \u2013 guitar\nPaulo J\u00fanior, aka Juninho \u2013 guitar\nJefferson Queiroz, aka Tigrilo \u2013 bass\nLuciano Juliato, aka Lobinho \u2013 drums\nGilberto Gomes, aka China \u2013 bass\n\n\n\nVoices (1997,  Liberation Records (Brazil))\nWhat Was Done (1999, Catalyst Records)\nCentelha (2000, Liberation Records (Brazil))\nSparks (2001, Catalyst Records \u2013 Centelha US release)\nLiberdade Imposta, Liberdade Conquistada (2002, Liberation Records (Brazil))\nImposed Freedom, Conquered Freedom (2002, Scorched Earth Police \u2013 Liberdade...
