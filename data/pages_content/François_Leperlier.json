  "body": "Fran\u00e7ois Leperlier (born 1949) is a French writer, essayist, poet, philosopher and art historian, known especially for his work on the surrealist writer and photographer Claude Cahun. Leperlier dedicated a large part of his life's work to the rehabilitation and recognition of Cahun's creative works, having rediscovered her nearly 40 years after her 1954 death, including writing about Cahun's work in his autobiography and editing a collection of her writings. He contributed to many edited volumes, journals, exhibition catalogs, conference proceedings, and participated in radio broadcasts (France Culture).\n\n\n\nClaude Cahun, Aveux non avenus (Fayard, 2011)\nClaude Cahun, L'Exotisme Int\u00e9rieur (Fayard, 2006)\nH\u00e9ro\u00efnes by Claude Cahun (editor) (Mille et une nuits, 2006)\nClaude Cahun, Ecrits (editor) (Jean Michel Place, 2002)\nClaude Cahun (introduction) (1999)\nMise En Scene\t(contributor) (1996)\nContre temps (author) (Paul Vermont, 1978)\n\n\n",
