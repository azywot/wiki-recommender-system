  "body": "\u01c3Kung  (\u01c3Xun), also known as Ju, is a dialect continuum (language complex) spoken in Namibia, Botswana, and Angola by the \u01c3Kung people, constituting two or three languages. Together with the \u01c2\u02bcAmkoe language, \u01c3Kung forms the Kx\u02bca language family. \u01c3Kung constituted one of the branches of the putative Khoisan language family, and was called Northern Khoisan in that scenario, but the unity of Khoisan has never been demonstrated and is now regarded as spurious. Nonetheless, the anthropological term \"Khoisan\" has been retained as an umbrella term for click languages in general.\u01c3Kung is famous for its many clicks, such as the \u01c3 in its name, and has some of the most complex inventories of both consonants and vowels in the world. It also has tone. For a description, see Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan. To pronounce \u01c3Xuun (pronounced [\u01c3\u0361\u03c7\u0169\u02d0\u02e6\u02e5] in Western \u01c3Kung/\u01c3Xuun) one makes a click sound before the x sound (which is like a Scottish or German ch), followed by a long nasal u vowel with a high rising tone.\n\n\n\nThe term \u01c3Kung, or variants thereof, is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute a single language; Ju tends to be used when considering them as a small language family. \u01c3Kung is also sometimes used for the northern/northwestern dialects, as opposed to the well documented Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan dialects in the south(east); however speakers of nearly all dialects call themselves \u01c3Kung.\nThe spellings \u01c3Xun and \u01c3Xuun seen in recent literature are related to the Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan form spelled \u01c3X\u02bcu(u)n in the 1975 orthography, or \u01c3Ku(u)n in current orthography. Additional spellings are \u01c3Hu, \u01c3Khung, \u01c3Ku, Kung, Qx\u00fc, \u01c3ung, \u01c3Xo, X\u00fb, \u01c3X\u00fb, Xun, \u01c3Xung, \u01c3X\u0169\u0169, \u01c3Xun, \u0297h\u0169:, and additional spellings of Ju are Dzu, Juu, Zhu.\n\n\n\nIf the \u01c3Kung dialects are counted together, they would make the third-most-populous click language after Khoekhoe and Sandawe.  The most populous \u01c3Kung variety, Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan, is perhaps tied for third place with Naro.\nEstimates vary, but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms, interspersed with speakers of other languages, but Brenzinger (2011) counts 9,000 in Namibia, 2,000 in Botswana, 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola (down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975).\nUntil the mid\u2013late twentieth century, the northern dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However, most \u01c3Kung fled the Angolan Civil War to Namibia (primarily to the Caprivi Strip), where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and SWAPO. At the end of the Border War, more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to Schmidtsdrift in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia. After more than a decade living in precarious conditions, the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for a permanent settlement at Platfontein, near Schmidtsdrift.Only Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan is written, and it is not sufficiently intelligible with the Northwestern dialects for the same literature to be used for both.\n\n\n\nThe better-known \u01c3Kung dialects are Tsumkwe Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan, Ekoka \u01c3Kung, \u01c3\u02bcO\u01c3Kung, and \u01c2Kx\u02bcau\u01c1\u02bcein. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects, but the boundaries are unclear. There is a clear distinction between North/Northwest vs South/Southeast, but also a diverse Central group that is poorly attested.\n\n\n\nHeine & Honken (2010) classify the 11 traditionally numbered dialects into three branches of what they consider a single language:\n\nNorthern\u2013Western \u01c3XunNorthern \u01c3Xun\n(N1) Maligo (\u01c3xuun, k\u00fa\u00e1nd\u00f2 \u01c3xuun \"Kwando \u01c3Xuun\"; SE Angola)\n(N2) \u01c3\u02bcO\u01c3Kung (\u01c3\u02bco \u01c3u\u014b \"Forest \u01c3Xuun\"; eastern C Angola)\nWestern \u01c3Xun\n(W1) \u2014 (\u01c3x\u016b\u00fan, \u01c3\u02bc\u0101l\u00e8 \u01c3x\u00f2\u0101n \"Valley \u01c3Xuun\"; Eenhana district, N Namibia)\n(W2) \u01c0\u02bcAkhwe (\u01c3x\u016b\u00fan, \u01c0\u02bc\u0101kh\u00f2\u00e8 \u01c3x\u00f2\u0101n \"Kwanyama \u01c3Xuun\"; Eenhana, N Namibia)\n(W3) Tsintsabis (\u01c3x\u016b\u00fan; Tsintsabis, Tsumeb district, N Namibia)\n(K) Kavango \u01c3Xuun (\u01c3x\u016b\u00fan, known as dom \u01c3x\u016b\u00fan \"River \u01c3Xuun\" in Ekoka; Western Rundu district, N Namibia, & Angola adjacent)Central \u01c3Xun(C1) Gaub (Tsumeb district, N Namibia)\n(C2) Neitsas (Grootfontein district, N Namibia)\ntentatively also the Tsintsabis, Leeunes and Mangetti (different from Mangetti Dune) dialectsSoutheastern \u01c3Xun(E1) Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan (ju-\u01c0\u02bchoan(-si); Tsumkwe district, N Namibia, & Bots adjacent)\n(E2) Dikundu (\u01c3xun, ju-\u01c0\u02bchoa(si); Dikundu, W Caprivi)\n(E3) \u01c2Kx\u02bcau\u01c1\u02bcein (ju-\u01c0\u02bchoan(-si), \u01c3xun, \u01c2x\u02bc\u0101\u014d\u01c1\u02bc\u00e0\u00e8n \"Northern people\"; Gobabis district, E Namibia)Heine & K\u00f6nig (2015, p. 324) state that speakers of all Northwestern dialects \"understand one another to quite some extent\" but that they do not understand any of the Southeastern dialects.\n\n\n\nSands (2010) classifies \u01c3Kung dialects into four clusters, with the first two being quite close:\n\nNorthern \u01c3Kung: Southern Angola, around the Cunene, Cubango, Cuito, and Cuando rivers, but with many refugees now in Namibia:\u01c3\u02bcO\u01c3Kung\nMaligoNorth-Central \u01c3Kung: Namibia, between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border, around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the Etosha Pan:Tsintsabis\nOkongo\nOvambo\nMpunguvlei\n\u01c0\u02bcAkhwe (Ekoka)Central \u01c3Kung: The area around Grootfontein, Namibia, west of the central Omatako River and south of the Ovambo River\nSoutheastern \u01c3Kung: Botswana east of the Okavango Delta, and northeast Namibia from near Windhoek to Rundu, Gobabis, and the Caprivi Strip:Tsumkwe\nOmatako\nKameeldoring\nEpukiro.\u01c2Kx\u02bcau\u01c1\u02bcein was too poorly attested to classify at the time.\n\n\n\nA preliminary classification of the !X\u0169\u0169 and \u017du\u01c0'h\u00f5asi dialects by Snyman (1997):\nSouthern (\u017du\u01c0\u02bch\u00f5ansi)\nEpukiro \u017du\u01c0\u02bch\u00f5ansi is bounded by the Omuramba Otjozondjou, stretching along the Omuramba Epukiro and north of the Sandfontein Omuramba up to Ghanzi in Botswana.\nTsumkwe \u017du\u01c0\u02bch\u00f5ansi is spoken east of 20\u00b0 longitude from the Omuramba Otjozondjou up to the Kaudom Omuramba and extending to Samagaigai in the west and 22\u00b0 longitude in Botswana.\nRundu \u017du\u01c0\u02bch\u00f5ansi presumably occurs south of the Okavango river from Rupara south-eastward to Ncaute and then north of the Omuramba Kaudom.\nOmatako \u017du\u01c0\u02bch\u00f5ansi consists of a northern dialect probably stretching from Ncaute southwards up to ca. 100km South of Karakuwisa, and a southern dialect extending southwards to include the tributaries of the Omatako, viz. the Omambonde, Klein Omatako and Gunib. The dialects are probably spoken in an area about 40 km wide along the river. According to the map in Westhpal (1956), the upper reaches of the Gunib Omuramba as well as the Omuramba Otjozondjou, i.e. the area between Okozonduzu Omazera and Blignaut, was Haillom territory. This area roughly lies on the watershed between the Omatako and the Otjozondjou which served as a natural boundary between the Epukiro and Omatako \u017du\u01c0\u02bch\u00f5ansi.\nCentral (!X\u0169\u0169)\nGrootfontein !X\u0169\u0169 is found in the district to the north-east, east and south-east of the town of Grootfontein.\nTsintsabis !X\u0169\u0169 is restricted to the North-eastern part of the Tsumeb district and adjacent areas in the western and eastern Mangetti.\nOkongo !X\u0169\u0169 is found in the Okongo, Olokula, Ekoka and Otyolo area of Northeastern Owambo.\nNorthern (!X\u0169\u0169)\nMpungu !X\u0169\u0169 occurs in the Tondoro and Mpungu area of the north-western Kavango and presumably in adjacent areas in Angola. This dialect clearly forms a transition from Okongo !X\u0169\u0169 to the other dialects of the Northern dialect cluster. Cuando/Quito !X\u0169\u0169 presumably belonged in the area between these rivers.\nQuilo/Cubango !X\u0169\u0169 presumably belonged in the area between these rivers.\nCubango/Cunene !X\u0169\u0169 presumably belonged in the area between these rivers.\n\n\n\nThe ancestral language, Proto-Juu or Proto-\u01c3Xuun, had five places of click articulation: Dental, alveolar, palatal, alveolar lateral, and retroflex (*\u203c). The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan, but remain in Central \u01c3Kung. In \u01c0\u02bcAkhwe (Ekoka), the palatal click has become a fricated alveolar.\n\n\n\n!Kung word lists (Wiktionary)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrenzinger, Matthias (2011).
